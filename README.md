 Lung cancer is one of the dangerous and life taking disease in the world. 
 Although, CT scan imaging is best imaging technique in medical field, it is difficult for doctors to interpret and identify the cancer from CT scan images. 
 However, variance of intensity in CT scan images and anatomical structure misjudgment by doctors and radiologists might cause difficulty in marking the cancerous cell.

 To detect and classify the lung cancer, advanced technologies like image processing techniques and machine learning techniques can be implemented. 
 The aim of our research is to design and implement an image processing system that intakes a CT scan image and detects the presence of carcinogenic cells.
